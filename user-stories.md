*User Stories for Bus Mall*

**Purpose/Why**

The app's purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

1. Need three forms, same size, to display 3 up pics

2. User need to be able to click the pics and I need to kno that they did

3. App needs to be able store the user's choices and then show the results (by name I assume)

4. User muct click at least 25 times

5. App also needs to produce the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown, and show the user.

6. The display should be something like "3 votes for the Banana Slicer"
